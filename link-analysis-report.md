## Network Analysis

### Key Observations

1. **Hub Notes**: The most connected notes serve as central concepts linking different areas
2. **Clustering**: Notes naturally cluster around projects (UltraThink, CAM, Contexify)
3. **Bridge Concepts**: Some notes bridge between different philosophical approaches

### Recommendations

1. **Connect Orphaned Notes**: Review orphaned notes and add relevant links
2. **Strengthen Cross-Project Links**: Add more connections between project boundaries
3. **Bidirectional Links**: Ensure important relationships have links in both directions
4. **Concept Definitions**: Link to concept definitions when terms are mentioned

## Implementation Guide

To implement suggested links:

1. Review each suggestion in context
2. Add wiki links where appropriate: `[[Target Note]]`
3. Consider adding context: `[[Target Note|descriptive text]]`
4. Update both directions for important relationships

## Next Steps

1. Process high-value link suggestions
2. Create "See Also" sections in orphaned notes
3. Add concept maps to visualize connections
4. Regular link audits to maintain graph health
