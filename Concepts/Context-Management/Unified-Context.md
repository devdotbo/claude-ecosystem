# Unified Context Management

## Definition

Maintaining all conversation history, decisions, and state in a single, coherent thread accessible to one agent.

## Implementation in UltraThink

[[Claude-UltraThink]] achieves unified context through:
- Single conversation thread
- No context splitting or handoffs
- Complete history preservation
- Direct access to all information

## Benefits

1. **No Information Loss**
   - Everything stays in one place
   - No handoff failures
   - Complete decision history

2. **Immediate Access**
   - O(1) context retrieval
   - No coordination needed
   - Full information for decisions

3. **Consistency**
   - Same context for all decisions
   - No conflicting information
   - Unified reasoning process

## Contrast with Distributed

Unlike [[Distributed-Context]], unified context:
- Eliminates synchronization needs
- Prevents fragmentation
- Maintains coherence
- Simplifies debugging

## Validation

[[Contexify|Claude-Contexify's]] research on [[Context-Window-Reality]] shows that even with limitations, unified context outperforms distributed approaches.

## Best Practices

- Use conversation threads as context storage
- Avoid splitting context across systems
- Maintain linear processing
- Update context incrementally
