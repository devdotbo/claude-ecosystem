# Distributed Context Management

## Definition

Splitting conversation history, state, and decisions across multiple agents or systems, requiring coordination for complete information.

## Implementation in CAM

[[Claude-AM]] implements distributed context through:
- Multiple agents holding partial information
- Session management across agents
- Inter-agent messaging for context sharing
- Complex handoff protocols

## Theoretical Benefits

1. **Specialization**
   - Each agent maintains domain-specific context
   - Reduced memory per agent
   - Focused information storage

2. **Parallel Processing**
   - Multiple agents access their context simultaneously
   - No single bottleneck
   - Distributed load

## Practical Problems

As [[Cognition-AI-Research]] warns:

### Context Fragmentation
- Information split unnaturally
- Agents lack complete picture
- Decision quality suffers

### Synchronization Overhead
```
Agent A context + Agent B context + Coordination = Slower than unified
```

### Handoff Failures
- Context lost during transfers
- Inconsistent state between agents
- Recovery complexity

## Evidence from CAM

Recent development shows these challenges:
- `sdk(persistence): implement distributed session management`
- Complex coordination required
- Multiple potential failure points

## When It Might Work

- Truly independent contexts
- No cross-agent decisions needed
- Failure tolerance is high
- Clear context boundaries

Currently, [[Unified-Context]] remains superior for most use cases.
