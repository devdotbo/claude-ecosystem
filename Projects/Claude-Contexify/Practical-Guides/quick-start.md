# Quick Start Guide

## 5-Minute Setup for Immediate Results

This guide gets you started with context window optimization in under 5 minutes. Pick your scenario and follow the steps.

## Choose Your Scenario

### üöÄ "I need results RIGHT NOW"
‚Üí Jump to [[Position Hacking Express]]

### üìö "I have a huge document to analyze"
‚Üí Jump to [[Document Analysis Fast Track]]

### üí¨ "I'm building a chatbot"
‚Üí Jump to [[Chatbot Quick Setup]]

### üîç "I need specific information from many documents"
‚Üí Jump to [[Information Extraction Sprint]]

## Position Hacking Express

**Time Required**: 1 minute
**Improvement**: 30-50% better results immediately

### The 30-Second Rule
Transform any prompt using this template:

```
‚ùå BEFORE:
[Your content]
[Your question]

‚úÖ AFTER:
TASK: [Your question]
CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS: [Any requirements]

CONTENT:
[Your content]

ANSWER THE TASK: [Repeat your question]
```

### Real Example
```python
# ‚ùå Poor Position
prompt = f"""
Here is our Q4 financial report:
{report_text}

What was the total revenue?
"""

# ‚úÖ Optimized Position
prompt = f"""
TASK: Find and report the total Q4 revenue

DOCUMENT:
{report_text}

EXTRACT: Total Q4 revenue from the document above.
"""
```

### Instant Improvements
1. Put instructions FIRST
2. Put key facts LAST
3. Add "REMEMBER:" before critical points
4. Use CAPS for emphasis

## Document Analysis Fast Track

**Time Required**: 5 minutes
**Tokens Saved**: 80-90%

### Option 1: Summary Chain (No Code)
```
Step 1: Split your document
- Break into 10-20 page sections
- Keep related content together

Step 2: Summarize each section
Prompt: "Summarize this section in 500 words, focusing on [YOUR TOPIC]:"

Step 3: Combine summaries
Prompt: "Create a comprehensive analysis from these summaries:
Summary 1: [paste]
Summary 2: [paste]
Summary 3: [paste]"
```

### Option 2: Strategic Chunking (Quick Filter)
```python
# Quick implementation
def quick_chunk_filter(document, topic):
    chunks = document.split('\n\n')  # Split by paragraphs
    relevant = []
    
    for chunk in chunks:
        if any(keyword in chunk.lower() for keyword in topic.lower().split()):
            relevant.append(chunk)
    
    return '\n\n'.join(relevant)

# Use it
filtered_doc = quick_chunk_filter(full_document, "revenue financial Q4")
# Now process only filtered_doc instead of full_document
```

## Chatbot Quick Setup

**Time Required**: 3 minutes
**Quality Improvement**: Significant

### Basic Context Budget Template
```python
CHATBOT_CONTEXT = {
    'system_message': """You are a helpful assistant.
    Always be concise and accurate.""",  # 15 tokens
    
    'conversation_buffer': 2000,  # Reserve for conversation
    'knowledge_base': 3000,       # For retrieved info
    'current_query': 1000,        # Current interaction
}
```

### Quick Chatbot Prompt Template
```python
def format_chatbot_prompt(query, context, history):
    return f"""
ROLE: Helpful assistant
CONTEXT: {context[:3000]}  # Limit context

CONVERSATION HISTORY (recent):
{history[-1000:]}  # Last 1000 chars

USER QUERY: {query}

RESPONSE (be concise):"""
```

## Information Extraction Sprint

**Time Required**: 4 minutes
**Accuracy**: High

### The 2-Pass Method
```python
# Pass 1: Find relevant sections
def quick_relevance_check(text, looking_for):
    prompt = f"""
    Does this text contain information about {looking_for}?
    Text preview: {text[:500]}
    Answer YES or NO only.
    """
    # Check each section
    
# Pass 2: Extract from relevant sections only
def extract_info(relevant_sections, looking_for):
    prompt = f"""
    Extract all information about {looking_for}:
    
    {relevant_sections}
    
    List all relevant facts:
    """
    # Process only relevant content
```

## Emergency Fixes

### üö® "My prompt is too long!"
```python
# Quick Fix 1: Summary Chain
sections = split_into_chunks(content, 2000)
summaries = [summarize(s) for s in sections]
final_prompt = f"Based on these summaries: {summaries}"

# Quick Fix 2: Strategic Filter
important_parts = [p for p in paragraphs if any(keyword in p for keyword in keywords)]
final_prompt = f"Analyze: {' '.join(important_parts)}"
```

### üö® "Getting wrong answers!"
```python
# Position Hacking Fix
prompt = f"""
CRITICAL: {what_you_really_need}
IGNORE: {what_to_ignore}

{content}

REMEMBER: Focus only on {what_you_really_need}
"""
```

### üö® "Too expensive!"
```python
# Budget Fix
essential_only = {
    'query': query,
    'key_context': context[:1000],  # Trim to essential
    'instruction': 'Be extremely concise'
}
```
