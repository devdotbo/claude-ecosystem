# Claude-Contexify Project Overview

## What is Claude-Contexify?

Claude-Contexify provides practical strategies for working with LLM context window limitations. It bridges the gap between advertised capabilities and real-world performance.

## Core Reality: The 10% Rule

**Marketing**: "1 million token context window!"
**Reality**: Expect only 10% effectiveness (~100k tokens)

## Five Core Strategies

1. **[[RAG-Strategy]]** - Retrieval Augmented Generation
2. **[[Summary-Chains]]** - Incremental summarization
3. **[[Strategic-Chunking]]** - Optimal content division
4. **[[Context-Budgeting]]** - Token allocation strategies
5. **[[Position-Hacking]]** - Exploiting attention patterns

## Key Insights

- **[[U-Shaped-Attention]]** - Models pay most attention to beginning and end
- **[[Context-Window-Reality]]** - Performance degrades with size
- **[[Practical-Workarounds]]** - Real solutions for real limitations

## Applications

- Document analysis
- Codebase understanding
- Knowledge management
- Long conversation handling

## Relationship to Other Projects

- Validates [[UltraThink|UltraThink's]] unified context approach
- Explains why [[Claude-AM|CAM's]] distributed context is problematic
- Provides practical solutions for both architectures
