# Claude-UltraThink Project Overview

## What is UltraThink?

UltraThink is a **methodology** (not a framework) for effective single-agent development in Claude Code, based on [[Cognition-AI-Research|Cognition.ai's "Don't Build Multi-Agents"]] research.

## Core Philosophy

- **[[Single-Agent-Architecture]]** - One agent handles everything
- **[[Linear-Task-Processing]]** - Sequential execution, no parallelism
- **[[TodoWrite-Workflow]]** - Systematic task planning
- **[[Complete-Context-Preservation]]** - Full conversation history

## Key Differentiator

Unlike [[Claude-AM]] which uses 7+ specialized agents, UltraThink proves that a single agent with proper methodology outperforms complex multi-agent systems.

## Implementation

- **2 command files** vs CAM's 4,250+ lines
- **Zero dependencies** vs complex coordination systems
- **Immediate execution** vs coordination delays

## Research Foundation

Based on [[Cognition-AI-Research]] showing that current multi-agent systems create "fragile systems" with context fragmentation and coordination failures.

## Related Concepts

- Opposed to: [[Multi-Agent-Orchestration]]
- Complements: [[Context-Window-Reality]] strategies from [[Claude-Contexify]]
- Validates: [[Dont-Build-Multi-Agents]] principle
