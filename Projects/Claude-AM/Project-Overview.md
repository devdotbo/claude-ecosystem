# Claude-AM (Agentic Maestro) Project Overview

## What is Claude-AM?

Claude-AM is a self-bootstrapping multi-agent system where AI agents build and coordinate themselves. It represents the opposite approach to [[Claude-UltraThink]], implementing complex multi-agent orchestration.

## Architecture

### 7+ Specialized Agents:
- **[[Maestro-Agent]]** - Orchestrator and coordinator
- **[[Seshy-Agent]]** - Session management and handoffs
- **[[Tasky-Agent]]** - Task management and delegation
- **[[Testy-Agent]]** - Testing and quality assurance
- **[[Versio-Agent]]** - Version control automation
- **[[Docsy-Agent]]** - Documentation generation
- **[[Speaky-Agent]]** - Voice interaction system

## Key Characteristics

- **[[Multi-Agent-Orchestration]]** - Complex coordination protocols
- **[[Distributed-Context]]** - Context split across agents
- **[[Inter-Agent-Messaging]]** - Communication system between agents
- **[[Self-Building-Architecture]]** - Agents construct themselves

## Complexity Metrics

- **~4,250 lines of code** (vs UltraThink's 2 files)
- **Complex SDK layer** for agent communication
- **Distributed session management**
- **Multiple failure points**

## Research Conflict

CAM directly contradicts [[Cognition-AI-Research|Cognition.ai's recommendations]], implementing exactly what the research warns against: fragmented context and complex coordination.

## Related Concepts

- Opposed to: [[Single-Agent-Architecture]]
- Implements: [[Multi-Agent-Orchestration]]
- Creates: [[Context-Fragmentation]]
