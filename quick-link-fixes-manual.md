# Quick Link Fixes

Copy and paste these snippets to quickly add suggested links and improve the knowledge graph connectivity.

## Priority 1: Connect CAM Agents

### For Maestro/CLAUDE.md
```markdown
## See Also
- [[Multi-Agent-Orchestration]] - The architectural pattern Maestro implements
- [[Claude-AM]] - Parent project
- [[Seshy-Agent]] - Handles session management handoffs
- [[Distributed-Context]] - Result of multi-agent coordination
- [[UltraThink-vs-CAM]] - Comparison with single-agent approach
```

### For Seshy/CLAUDE.md
```markdown
## See Also
- [[Multi-Agent-Orchestration]] - The architectural pattern Seshy supports
- [[Claude-AM]] - Parent project
- [[Maestro-Agent]] - Orchestrator that coordinates with Seshy
- [[Context-Fragmentation]] - Challenge Seshy tries to solve
- [[Session-Management]] - Core concept category
```

### For Tasky/CLAUDE.md
```markdown
## See Also
- [[Multi-Agent-Orchestration]] - The architectural pattern Tasky implements
- [[Claude-AM]] - Parent project
- [[TodoWrite-Workflow]] - Similar task management concept
- [[Linear-Task-Processing]] - Contrasting approach in UltraThink
- [[Distributed-Context]] - How tasks are managed across agents
```

## Priority 2: Strengthen Philosophy Connections

### In Methodology-Over-Framework.md
Add after the main content:
```markdown
## Implementations
- [[Claude-UltraThink]] - Prime example of methodology over framework
- [[Evolution-Story]] - The transformation from 1,500 lines to 2 files

## Contrasts With
- [[Claude-AM]] - Complex framework approach
- [[Multi-Agent-Orchestration]] - Framework-heavy pattern
```

### In Dont-Build-Multi-Agents.md
Add connections to implementations:
```markdown
## Real-World Applications
- [[Claude-UltraThink]] - Implements these principles
- [[Single-Agent-Architecture]] - The recommended approach
- [[UltraThink-vs-CAM]] - Direct comparison proving the research

## Evidence Against Multi-Agent
- [[Claude-AM]] - Demonstrates the warned complexity
- [[Distributed-Context]] - The fragmentation problem
- [[Context-Management-Approaches]] - Comparison of strategies
```

## Priority 3: Create Topic Bridges

### In Context-Management-Approaches.md
Ensure these links exist:
```markdown
The three approaches examined:
- [[Unified-Context]] - UltraThink's approach
- [[Distributed-Context]] - CAM's challenge  
- [[Context-Window-Reality]] - Contexify's focus

Each project takes a different stance:
- [[Claude-UltraThink]] maintains unified context
- [[Claude-AM]] distributes across agents
- [[Claude-Contexify]] optimizes within limits
```

### In Linear-Task-Processing.md
Add comparison links:
```markdown
## Implementations
- [[Claude-UltraThink]] - Pure linear processing
- [[TodoWrite-Workflow]] - The tool enabling linear flow

## Contrasts With
- [[Multi-Agent-Orchestration]] - Parallel processing attempts
- [[Claude-AM]] - Complex task coordination
- [[Performance-Trade-offs]] - Why linear often wins
```

## Priority 4: Research Connections

### In Cognition-AI-Research-Enhanced.md
Ensure bidirectional links:
```markdown
## Implementations Following Research
- [[Claude-UltraThink]] - Directly implements recommendations
- [[Single-Agent-Architecture]] - The recommended pattern
- [[Linear-Task-Processing]] - Suggested approach

## Implementations Contradicting Research  
- [[Claude-AM]] - Multi-agent despite warnings
- [[Multi-Agent-Orchestration]] - The discouraged pattern
- [[Distributed-Context]] - The fragmentation problem
```

## Priority 5: Cross-Project Learning Paths

### Create in Projects/Claude-UltraThink/
Add to Overview.md:
```markdown
## Learning Path
1. Start: [[Single-Agent-Architecture]]
2. Research: [[Cognition-AI-Research]]
3. Methodology: [[Methodology-Over-Framework]]
4. Implementation: [[Linear-Task-Processing]]
5. Comparison: [[UltraThink-vs-CAM]]
```

### Create in Projects/Claude-AM/
Add to Overview.md:
```markdown
## Learning Path
1. Start: [[Multi-Agent-Orchestration]]
2. Architecture: [[Distributed-Context]]
3. Agents: [[Maestro-Agent]], [[Seshy-Agent]], [[Tasky-Agent]]
4. Challenges: [[Context-Fragmentation]]
5. Comparison: [[UltraThink-vs-CAM]]
```

## Application Instructions

1. Open each file mentioned
2. Add the suggested "See Also" or link sections
3. Ensure links work in both directions
4. Test in Obsidian's graph view
5. Commit changes with message: "feat: strengthen knowledge graph connections"

After applying these fixes, the knowledge graph will have much stronger interconnections between concepts, making it easier to navigate and understand the relationships between different approaches.
