# Cognition.ai Research: Don't Build Multi-Agents

## Core Finding

> "Current multi-agent collaboration produces 'fragile systems'. Agents struggle to effectively share and communicate context."

## Key Recommendations

1. **Use Single Agents** - More reliable than multi-agent systems
2. **Maintain Complete Context** - Avoid fragmentation across agents
3. **Linear Processing** - Sequential execution over parallel coordination
4. **Actions Carry Decisions** - Prevent conflicting implicit assumptions

## Evidence from Practice

### CAM Validates the Warnings
Recent commits show exactly what the research warns against:
- Distributed session management
- Inter-agent messaging systems
- Complex coordination layers

### UltraThink Implements Solutions
- Single agent architecture
- Complete context preservation
- Linear task processing
- No coordination overhead
