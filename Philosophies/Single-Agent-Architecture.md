# Single-Agent Architecture Philosophy

## Core Principle

A single, unified agent with complete context outperforms multiple specialized agents with fragmented context.

## Foundation

Based on [[Cognition-AI-Research|Cognition.ai's "Don't Build Multi-Agents"]] research showing that multi-agent systems create:
- Context fragmentation
- Coordination overhead
- Communication failures
- Increased complexity

## Implementation in UltraThink

[[Claude-UltraThink]] embodies this philosophy through:
- **Unified decision-making** - One agent, consistent reasoning
- **Complete context** - Full conversation history available
- **Linear processing** - Sequential execution without coordination
- **Zero overhead** - No inter-agent communication

## Benefits

1. **Reliability** - Single point of control
2. **Performance** - No coordination delays
3. **Simplicity** - Easier to debug and maintain
4. **Consistency** - Unified reasoning patterns

## Contrast with Multi-Agent

Unlike [[Multi-Agent-Orchestration]], single-agent architecture:
- Eliminates context handoff problems
- Removes coordination complexity
- Provides immediate execution
- Maintains complete information

## Future Evolution

While current research favors single agents, this may evolve as:
- Agent communication improves
- Context sharing mechanisms advance
- New coordination protocols emerge

For now, single-agent remains the most reliable approach.
